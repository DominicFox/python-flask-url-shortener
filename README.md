Here is a **video demo** of the website:

The project is created with Flask. I wrote an HTML template document for displaying the page nicely and also used tailwindcss for the styling (which was not necessary but I'd not used tailwind before and thought it would be a simple project to learn some fundamentals of the framework).

For the database storage, I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy. The database is just one table and each record simply stores the shorturl, longurl and creation date.
